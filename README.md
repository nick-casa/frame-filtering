# frame-filtering

To use frame filtering, use client_LRU.py, the results of inference will be saved to .pkl files, which can be evaluated for accuracy using getInfo.py. To use client without frame filtering, use client_nofiltering.py.

Use result .pkl files and dataset annotation files to play videos with bounding boxes via playVideosWithBoxes.py.
